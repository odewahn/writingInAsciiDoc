== Ubuntu Quick Start

To get started as quickly as possible, find an Ubuntu installation and run the following commands:

----
sudo apt-get install git-core asciidoc fop
git clone https://github.com/odewahn/writingInAsciiDoc.git
cd /path/to/writingInAsciiDoc
./compile.sh
evince book.pdf
----

These commands will install the git version control system along with tools for working with AsciiDoc and generating PDF output, clone the master git repository for this document from GitHub, compile a fresh copy of this document, and view it. Try editing one of the .asc files, recompiling, and viewing your changes!
