== Incorporating a pull request

These are the steps I followed to incorporate the changes that had been made

=== Pull in the changes from the remote

The first step is to grab the changes that have been made. We'll first add the remote repository, fetch it, and then check it out into a new branch called "robson".  

----
$ git remote add robson https://github.com/bethrobson/writingInAsciiDoc.git

$ git fetch robson

$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/robson/master

$ git checkout -b robson remotes/robson/master
Branch robson set up to track remote branch master from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'robson'

$ git branch -a
  master
* robson
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/robson/master

----

Now all the changes are in a new branch.
